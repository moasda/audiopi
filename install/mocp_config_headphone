# Under some circumstances on 32-bit systems, audio played continously
# for long periods of time may begin to stutter.  Setting this option to
# 'yes' will force MOC to avoid ALSA's dmix resampling and prevent this
# stutter.  But it also has other implications:
#
# - You may experience unacceptably high CPU load.
# - ALSA's resampler plug-ins will not be used.
# - The resampling may be of lower quality than ALSA would provide.
# - You may need to try different "ResampleMethod" option settings.
# - The "ForceSampleRate" option may be ineffective.
# - If libsamplerate is not configured, many audios may be unplayable.
